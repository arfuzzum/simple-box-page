# The simple box page

The code in this repo has one job: To help you add a scalable box with round corners and a nice shadow to your Tableau dashboards.

## How to make it work
- Add a webpage element to your dashboard
- Set the URL to https://arfuzzum.github.io/simple-box-page/
- Set the X and Y size and position of the webpage element to your liking
- Add the sheet containing your report or visualisation
- Set the X and Y size and position to the same as your webpage element
- Set the outer padding to 40px for all sides, to accomodate for the 20px margin on the webpage

If your background colors are anything but white you can set the background color of both the webpage and the box by using URL parameters, e.g.
- https://arfuzzum.github.io/simple-box-page/?bgColor=f5f5f5
- https://arfuzzum.github.io/simple-box-page/?bgColor=f5f5f5&boxColor=FFFFC5

The corner radius and shadow size cannot be changed.
